# FilterFaceTwo
Hello Everyone

This is my Tutorial on a basic AR Face Filter, Some basic Knowledge of Unity, Visual Studio and C#.

Here is the app to try on Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RedQueenGaming.FilterFace&pcampaignid=web_share and to see what you could develop once you complete this short course.

There is 3 Scenes: Facemesh, Objects and Glasses. 

This is a take on Unity AR Face Filter Learn Course: https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-ar-face-filters.

Though with my Tutorial, i use C# instead of Visual scripting to get things to work. I was a bit sick when i did this so sorry for any volume/voice issues.

For some reason when i right click to select my options, it does not show in the video, but i do say what I'm doing , when I'm doing it.

Steps to create project:
Create new project in Unity Hub, using the AR Mobile Template that is provided in the Hub. The thumb nail for this tutorial shows where to find this.

Make sure you have switched the platform to ANDROID. 

To help with the rest of the videos, you may want to watch the "TheScriptsFilter" Video {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK8t5h4KDIU}, and create the ALL the scripts so when you follow my tutorial, you will understand what the scripts are doing.

First package downloaded was the "BasicFaceFilter"

Second package "InteractiveFacFilterAssets ".

These are the steps i did that you cant see:

1/ React Transform - Click the square where my mouse is - [Hold shift & ALT] then click the center
